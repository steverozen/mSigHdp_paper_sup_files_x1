1. Run mSigHdp_ds_10k on SBS_set2 (running, very slow)
2. SynSigEval -- need Bioconductor? need mSigAct?
3. Rename_SP_files_level1_dirs: The level1_dirs doesn't have the spike in data? 
4. Could we just include this code in summarize_level1_dirs.R?
5. SigneR, SBS_set1, indel_set1, signeR 1.20.0 (Started)
6. Re-run mSigHdp_ds_*k, seed 145879 on SBS_set1/Realistic (Started)
7. Sigpro results for K = what mSigHdp found (Started, some results needs 6.)
