1. Run mSigHdp_ds_10k on SBS_set2 (running on HPC, very slow)

2. Re-run mSigHdp_ds_*k, seed 145879 on SBS_set1/Realistic (Started)

3. Complete Supp Table S5 - Sigpro results for K = what mSigHdp found (Started, some results needs 6.)

4. Check CPU time data
4.1 What machine did you do the CPU time profiling on?
- I do the CPU profiling on my local PC (Windows 11).
  Nevertheless, this does not affect the CPU profiling results, as the 
  CPU time object was generated by the machine used to run the job.

4.2 It is very strange that for MR_hdp_gb_50 and SignatureAnalyzer, indel_set1 took much longer than indel_set2. Is there any chance you ran these on a slower machine, maybe monster? <Awaiting Steve's comment>
- NR_hdp_gb_50 (indel_set1) was run by Prof Steve on HPC-cluster.
  NR_hdp_gb_50 (indel_set2) was run by Wu Yang on HPC-cluster.
  This suggest that Prof Steve's code might be less efficient than
  Wu Yang's code.
- SignatureAnalyzer (indel_set1) was run by Wu Yang on monster2.
  SignatureAnalyzer (indel_set2) was run by Wu Yang on HPC-cluster.
  This implies that HPC-cluster might be faster than monster2.
Q: Does Wu Yang need to re-run both programs on indel_set1?
- Yes. Rerun all the "Realistic" indel jobs that were previously not on HPC
  on HPC. (Started)

5. We need to explain why there is no result for NR_hdp_gb_1 for SBS_set2 (what is reason?) (Started)
- Actually, it has been running on minimonster for 22 days (since Aug 30th). 
  We will get the results soon (within one week).
  
6. Simplify mSigHdp_paper_tracking.xlsx to one sheet - only record "Realistic" runs for CPU profiling.
