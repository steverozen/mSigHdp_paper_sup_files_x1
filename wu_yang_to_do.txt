1. Run mSigHdp_ds_10k on SBS_set2 (running, very slow)
2. SynSigEval -- need Bioconductor? need mSigAct? [Addressed]
- Requires Bioconductor, as the its dependency "ICAMS" does
- Does not require mSigAct
3. Rename_SP_files_level1_dirs: The level1_dirs doesn't have the spike in data? [Addressed]
It does. See line 21:
```
level1_dirs <- c(level1_dirs,
                 paste0("sens_SBS35_",
                        c(5L, 10L, 20L, 30L, 50L, 100L),
                        "_728"),
                 paste0("sens_SBS35_",
                        c(5L, 10L, 20L, 30L, 50L, 100L),
                        "_1066"))
```
4. Could we just include this code in summarize_level1_dirs.R? [Done]
5. signeR, SBS_set1, indel_set1, signeR 1.20.0 (Started)
- signeR for SBS_set1 almost finished
6. Re-run mSigHdp_ds_*k, seed 145879 on SBS_set1/Realistic (Started)
7. Sigpro results for K = what mSigHdp found (Started, some results needs 6.)
8. Check CPU time data
8.1 What machine did you do the CPU time profiling on?
8.2 It is very strange that for MR_hdp_gb_50 and SignatureAnalyzer, indel_set1 took much longer than indel_set2. Is there any chance you ran these on a slower machine, maybe monster? <Awaiting Steve's comment>
- NR_hdp_gb_50 (indel_set1) was run by Prof Steve on HPC-cluster.
  NR_hdp_gb_50 (indel_set2) was run by Wu Yang on HPC-cluster.
  This suggest that Prof Steve's code might be less efficient than
  Wu Yang's code.
- SignatureAnalyzer (indel_set1) was run by Wu Yang on monster2.
  SignatureAnalyzer (indel_set2) was run by Wu Yang on HPC-cluster.
  This implies that HPC-cluster might be faster than monster2.
- Does Wu Yang need to re-run both programs on indel_set1?
9. There is no CPU timing result for signeR on indel_set1
10. We need to explain why there is no result for NR_hdp_gb_1 for SBS_set2 (what is reason?) <Partly addressed>
- Actually, it has been running on minimonster for 20 days. 
  We will get the results soon (within one week).
