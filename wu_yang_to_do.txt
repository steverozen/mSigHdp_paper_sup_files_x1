1. Run mSigHdp_ds_10k on SBS_set2 (running, very slow)
2. SynSigEval -- need Bioconductor? need mSigAct?
3. Rename_SP_files_level1_dirs: The level1_dirs doesn't have the spike in data? [Addressed]
It does. See line 21:
```
level1_dirs <- c(level1_dirs,
                 paste0("sens_SBS35_",
                        c(5L, 10L, 20L, 30L, 50L, 100L),
                        "_728"),
                 paste0("sens_SBS35_",
                        c(5L, 10L, 20L, 30L, 50L, 100L),
                        "_1066"))
```
4. Could we just include this code in summarize_level1_dirs.R? [Done]
5. SigneR, SBS_set1, indel_set1, signeR 1.20.0 (Started)
6. Re-run mSigHdp_ds_*k, seed 145879 on SBS_set1/Realistic (Started)
7. Sigpro results for K = what mSigHdp found (Started, some results needs 6.)
8. Check CPU time data
8.1 What machine did you do the CPU time profiling on?
8.2 It is very strange that for MR_hdp_gp_50 and SignatureAnalyzer, indel_set1 took much longer than indel_set2. Is there any chance you ran these on a slower machine, maybe monster?
9. There is no CPU timing result for signeR on indel_set1
10. We need to explain why there is no result for NR_hdp_gb_1 for SBS_set2 (what is reason?)
