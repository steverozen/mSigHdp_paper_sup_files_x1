### Directory structure

The main top-level folders are common_code, output_for_paper, and multiple folders, one for each dataset, e.g.  indel_set1.
(The â€¦down_samp folders use the corresponding full datasets, e.g. indel_set1_down_samp uses the same data as indel_set1.)

#### Data set directories

#### Data set directories at the top-level:
- indel_set1, indel_set2,
   `SBS_set1` and `SBS_set2` are the main synthetic data sets as documented in the paper.

-  indel_set1_down_samp, indel_set2_down_samp, `SBS_set1_down_samp` and
   `SBS_set2_down_samp` contain
   results of running mSigHdp with different downsampling thresholds
   on the synthetic data in indel_set1, indel_set2, SBS_set1, and SBS_set2.
   
- sens_SBS35_<NN>_728 and sens_SBS35_<NN>_1066 Data with SBS35
  "spiked in"; see Supplementary Figure S10.
