# Source of performance measures

The performance measures (composite measure and CPU time) to generate the summary plots were imported from:

* `SBS_down_samp/summary/`
* `SBS_2_down_samp/summary/`

The composite measures are available in `all_results.csv`, while the cpu times are in `cpu_time.csv`.
